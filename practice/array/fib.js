// Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to find the nth Fibonacci number.

// The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

// The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

// F(0) = 0
// F(1) = 1
// F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1
// Examples :

// Input: n = 5
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The 5th Fibonacci number is 5.

const fib = (n) => {
  console.log(n);
  if (n < 2) {
    return n;
  }
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
};

console.log(fib(5, [0, 1]));
